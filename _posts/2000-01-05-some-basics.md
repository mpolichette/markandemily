**Who is invited:**
We have large and wonderful families and networks of friends.  We know it is a destination for many of those being invited.  If you are making a trip of it with your family to see the west, we are excited about it!  Kids are welcome to come to the wedding and reception.  Let us know their ages and how much they eat (we don’t have kids and have no idea when solid food is eaten and how much a 8 year old would eat).  We also support parents having a kid free fun night and will be ready to recommend babysitters in the area to the best of our ability.  We are not issuing a + 1, so no need to ‘find a date’.  If you are in a committed relationship, we invite you partner.  Include both names on your RSVP.

**What to expect:**
The mass will be on Friday, June 24th, 2016 at either 5 or 5:30 PM.  (We are still working out details).  Reception will follow at the hall right next to the church.  We are having BBQ, Bikes, and Beers.  Come ready to dance and play!  It’s one of the longest days of the year so we’ll have great views of the mountains and light until fairly late.
The ‘After Party’... The day after the wedding, Michael and Marti Polichette will be hosting an afternoon/evening of yard games and merriment at their house in Wanship, UT.  If you are not local, we’ll have a long list of amazing things to do taking advantage of the Park City area and Uinta mountains while having a home-base to eat and rest at.  (Paddle boarding, hiking, whiskey tasting, Olympic Park, secret fairy gardens, and on and on and on).  Or just come chill with us at the Polichette house.
